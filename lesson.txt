How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

it was a nice way to see the difference between the two files 
better than manually chceking it 


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

saves time
how the file progressed can be seen
going back to some point in the development cycle will be easy
